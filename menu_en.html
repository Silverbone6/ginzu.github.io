              <p>Buenos Aires Inter Provintial Express is the future service that aims to connect the provinces' capital cities with Buenos Aires City. In addition to that, there are two services to the most turistic cities in the country, Mar del Plata and Bariloche. The network is limited to the broad gauge network, that doesn't reach every province in the country.</p>

              <p>Buenos Aires Inter Provintial Belgrano is the future service that compared to IPE, uses the metric gauge network, known as "Belgrano". It aims to connect every capital city where the IPE doesn't go. The metric gauge does reach other capital cities but due they are already served by IPE, there is no reason to include them. They will be included in regional Belgrano services.</p>

            <div class="description">
              <p>Cordoba lacks of a proper railway network. As the second biggest city in Argentina, I planned a metropolitan rail network with two sub-networks "Belgrano" for meter-gauge infrastructure, and "Mitre" with broad-gauge infrastructure. The Firstly the "Mountain Train" is extended to Capilla del Monte. Then, a second line is added, that goes from the northern city of Jesus María, to the eastern city of Río Primero. Stops at Alta Córdoba, the most important city for the Belgrano network. Then for the Mitre line, three lines are used, from Cordoba to Malagueño, Alta Gracia and Pilar.</p>
